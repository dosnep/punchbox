# Alert if metadata older than 9 min is present
#
# 9 min explanation :
#
# The housekeeper retention time is 3 min. The housekeeper execution period is 5 min.
# After execution, the older valid metadata is 3 min old.
# Right before next execution, 5 min later, the older valid metadata is 5+3 min old. 
# We add 1 min for safety : result is 9 min.
